# Default Product Ports

This page describes the default ports used by each runtime of WSO2 API Manager.

!!! Note
    If you [change the default runtime ports]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/deployment-best-practices/changing-the-default-ports-with-offset), most of the runtime ports change automatically based on the offset.

## API-M ports

Listed below are the ports used by the API-M runtime when the [port offset]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/deployment-best-practices/changing-the-default-ports-with-offset/#configuring-the-port-offset) is 0.

!!! Info
    See the instructions on [changing the default API-I ports]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/deployment-best-practices/changing-the-default-ports-with-offset/#changing-the-default-api-m-ports).

## Random ports

Certain ports are randomly opened during server startup. This is due to the specific properties and configurations that become effective when the product is started. Note that the IDs of these random ports will change every time the server is started.

-   A random TCP port will open at server startup because the `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote` property is set in the server startup script. This property is used for the JMX monitoring facility in JVM.

-   A random UDP port is opened at server startup due to the log4j appender (`SyslogAppender`), which is configured in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j2.properties` file.
