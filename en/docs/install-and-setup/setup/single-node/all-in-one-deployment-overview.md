# All-in-One Deployment Overview

An all-in-one deployment contains all the API-M components in one runtime instance. This is easy to set up and requires less resources when compared with a distributed deployment. Although a distributed deployment provides high performance and a high level of scalability, it may be too complex if you want to a small to medium scale API management solution. The all-in-one deployment is ideal if you want to start small and iteratively build up a robust API management platform.

## Single Node Deployment

In this setup, API traffic is served by one all-in-one instance of WSO2 API Manager.

|    Production support is required only for a single API Manager node (you receive 24\*7 WSO2 production support). 
    Deployment is up and running within minutes.                                                                      
    Can handle up to 43 million API calls a day (up to 500 API calls a second)                                      
    Minimum hardware/cloud infrastructure requirements (only one node).                                             
    Suitable for anyone new to API Management.                                                                      |    Deployment does not provide High Availability.                                               
     Not network friendly. Deploying on a demilitarized zone (DMZ) would require a Reverse Proxy.  |

## Active - Active Deployment

In this setup, API traffic is served by two single node (all-in-one) instances of WSO2 API Manager.
